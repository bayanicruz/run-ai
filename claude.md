Intuition
- How can i use strava api to get my running data and claude ainto analyse that persistent dat
A either stored in a database or spreadsheet to coach me on my goals? Im thinking of either creating a web app for the ui or maybe just cli? But if cli then i cant access it on my phone

- Maybe ill build a web app that only contains a button that extracts the latest activity sends to my email in a format i can easily copy paste into a thread i have for personalised coaching

- I want to explore iOS shortcuts. How does it work? Remember it needs to be mobile friendly. How secure is this? Feels like any one can use the request as long as they have the endpoint

- I will build the api for the shortcut to call. This api will also callout the strava api and get all the info i need and return a response that is properly formatted to be pasted into claude thread

MVP
Manual Copy-Paste (Current Plan)
- API returns formatted text
- iOS Shortcut copies to clipboard
- You paste into your coaching thread
